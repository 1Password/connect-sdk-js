# OpenAPI Generator Ignore
# Generated by openapi-generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# Temporary workaround until v5.0.0 is stable
# Caused by 2 issues:
#   - when specifying `--global-property models` the output tries to reference a file that isn't generated (fixed by https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/7126)
#   - using 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT with `--global-property models` does not generate `models.ts`, so the generated models are still broken.
